Creating circuits for the first time:
1. history will give ip_address // Muneeb - Done
2. use ip_address to find nearest 5 exit nodes // Done
3. Use your own_ip to find 5 nearest entry_guards // Done
4. How to find middle node? // Underwork
	i. Find a node in middle (Can lead to traffic co-relation attack)
	ii. Find address which do max 16 bit longest prefix matches. Use those address to as middle node
5. Simulataneuosly launch ting between selected entry_guards to selected middle_nodes and then from selected middle_nodes to selected exit_nodes
6. Repeat two more times, take median value
7. Create 3 circuits // Easy to build
	best, 2nd best and 3rd best entry -> middle -> exit times
8. Try to access website using all three, to cater forwarding time aswell
9. Use the one which gives us fastest page load time.
10. Store the citcuit for future use.


Attaching Streams:
If you take a look at above algorithm step 1, history will give ip_address. It will give us alot of ip_address
Using weighted average we take the most used ones and create 5 separate circuits based on them.
When new request comes, we can quickly match to website's ip and circuits exit ip and find the most suitable circuit and attach its stream to it.

Refreshing Circuits:
There are few ways:
	i.  Completely make a circuit from scratch in background when time-slice (10 mins) for each circuit is about to expire. This can 		lead to creation same circuit again.
	ii. Use the 2nd and 3rd best circuits when we ran the first test. Step 7 of algorithm on top.
	iii.Only Change the middle node using prefix matching. (Will it open up possible attacks? I am not sure)

Problems to solve:
Beside some problems mentioned above, we need to be able to combine ting's code with our code. (Atm we can only use from terminal)
